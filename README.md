# [GOLANG]::Microservices in Go!

## Purpose

`[DISCLAIMER]:` This app is not mine, it's from this [UDEMY COURSE](https://www.udemy.com/course/working-with-microservices-in-go/).

The idea was initially to learn golang for web purpose, but I learn a lot of others things like **Docker, RabbitMQ (AMQP), Linux (WSL2), RPC/gRPC, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Make...** and most importantly `Golang`, How microservices works, How to create CRUD APP with JSON, Handling a router and a server, Working with go package and handling errors and how to structurate my projects, Reverse Proxy with Caddy. I also learn how to deploy all of this in the clear internet with Linode, managing my server...

Making this app taught me so much things in Backend development that I just couldn't not push it into my Github ðŸ˜….

As a result of this course, **I have a better understanding of Go** _(which was the orriginal idea)_ in which I'm much more confident. Also I'm now familiar with all kind of new existing stuff!

## App Description

In this course, we'll develop a number of small, self-contained, loosely coupled microservices that will will communicate with one another and a simple front-end application with a REST API, with RPC, over gRPC, and by sending and consuming messages using AMQP, the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol. The microservices we build will include the following functionality:

- A Front End service, that just displays web pages;
- An Authentication service, with a Postgres database;
- A Logging service, with a MongoDB database;
- A Listener service, which receives messages from RabbitMQ and acts upon them;
- A Broker service, which is an optional single point of entry into the microservice cluster;
- A Mail service, which takes a JSON payload, converts into a formatted email, and send it out.

All of these services will be written in Go, commonly referred to as Golang, a language which is particularly well suited to building distributed web applications.

We'll also learn how to deploy our distributed application to a Docker Swarm and Kubernetes, and how to scale up and down, as necessary, and to update individual microservices with little or no downtime.
